# Expectations coming into this

Now that I've completed the JavaScript Cert from freecodecamp.org, I want to test my JS knowledge using Typescript for this next project!

I've only heard good things with regards to Typescript and while I am not a master at JS, I do believe I am proficient enough to complete this project!

I'll be working on this daily until completion!

# Cool Project Features

So there's a couple things here that I would like to point out, firstly the on screen keyboard is clickable (each button), however you can also use your physical keyboard to enter the same keys. Each key press will check against the current random word (that was generated when the page loaded) and if the letter you typed/clicked is in the (selected random word) then it will highlight the letter with a light blue color. Otherwise it will fade that letter out on the on-screen keyboard and a body part of our "hangman" will appear.

The second cool feature here is if you lose, the program will show you the rest of the missing letters (in red letters) and then allow you to play again simply by hitting "Enter" or by refreshing the page!

The third cool feature is the Font I put on this one, I love the gaming font and the black background! Reminds me of when I was a kid and played web browser games on those gaming sites (can't remember the specific site names).

Lots of functions in this project so was really able to practice those Javascript methods here so that's good too!

# Afterthoughts

I want to do more projects like this moving forward!

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy creating web app sites, however creating functional games like this is a bit more fun and it's a cool thing to show my friends and family that they can actually use if they are bored haha!
