Project in Progress!

Link: N/A as of now!

# Expectations coming into this

Now that I've completed the JavaScript Cert from freecodecamp.org, I want to test my JS knowledge using Typescript for this next project!

I've only heard good things with regards to Typescript and while I am not a master at JS, I do believe I am proficient enough to complete this project!

I'll be working on this daily until completion!

# Tools used in this Project
